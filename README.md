Shortest path of 2 points exercise.

in this project we will use an open-source to solve the problam of finding the shortest path betwen two points.

the problam:

some of the points will be defined as "black-listed" and the path must not go through them.

How we solve it:

In this project we show a Java priority queue using binary heap implementation of the Dijkstra's shortest path Algorithm.

The open-source we used:
